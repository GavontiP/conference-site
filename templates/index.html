        The idea behind the Event Connections Conference is a bringing all parts
        of the event industry together. Weâ€™re inviting musicians, brands, clothing
        lines, venues, night clubs, DJs, catering services and many more qualified
        professionals to attend our conference. The conference is meant to be a
        learning experience for everyone through our workshops or just through
        dialogue with other professionals in your industry. All capped off with
        our own Connections Conference Party where attendees can have fun while
        meeting like minded professionals and maybe doing a bit of networking.
